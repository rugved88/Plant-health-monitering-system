# Plant Health Monitoring System

## Introduction
The **Plant Health Monitoring System** represents an innovative solution to the challenge of real-time monitoring and adjustment of environmental conditions for optimal plant health. This system seamlessly integrates various sensors and controls to ensure plants receive the ideal balance of moisture, light, and temperature.

## Key Objectives
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously assesses soil moisture, light intensity, temperature, and humidity.
- **Automated Adjustments:** Automatically regulates water and light based on threshold levels to maintain optimal plant health.
- **Remote Accessibility:** Offers a user-friendly interface to monitor and control the system remotely through a web-based application.

## System Components
### Sensors
1. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT):** Measures ambient temperature and humidity.
2. **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Monitors the moisture level in the soil.
3. **Automatic Light Sensor:** Detects and adjusts the light intensity for plant photosynthesis.

### Functionality
- **Water Management:** Automatically activates the motor pump when soil moisture falls below the set threshold.
- **Light Regulation:** Senses and adjusts light levels to ensure adequate photosynthesis.
- **Data Display:** Real-time display of temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity on a webpage, accessible globally through an app.
